html - all .html files besides index.html

    game.html - main game page

    settings.html - a page to edit game settings

js - all .js files

    main.js - has the main function in it

wasm - all .wasm files

    no files yet

css - all .css files

    styles.css - main css page

note: src stores the various files which are compiled to wasm

src - has the folowing directories:

  wat - all .wat files

    no files yet
  
  c -all .c files

    no files yet
  
  more will probably be added
