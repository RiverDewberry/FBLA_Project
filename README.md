# FBLA Project
## overveiw
This is a submision for the "Computer Game & Simulation Programming" event
## outline
This repo is structured such that if it was cloned, the directory could be run in an http-server, as such index.html not being in the html directory is necessary
### directories
note: this structure will likely be changed

html - stores all .html files besides index.html
js - all javascript files
wasm - all .wasm files
css - all css files

note: src stores the various files which are compiled to wasm
src - has the folowing directories
  wat - all .wat files
  more will probably be added
